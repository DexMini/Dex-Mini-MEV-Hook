# Guidelines for Writing an Effective README File
Let's write github documentation for the full code. Letâ€™s break it down step by step to explain what each function does, why it exists, and how it fits into the broader context of the contract. You should go through Key components, scenario examples from LPs points of view, Users points of view and protocol points of views, system architecture and code walkthrough.
Make sure to include a clear table of content and it should flow perfectly. Add fancy design to avoid dull colorless readme.
