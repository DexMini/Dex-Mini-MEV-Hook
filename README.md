# MEV Protection Hook

The **MEV Protection Hook** is a Uniswap V4 hook designed to protect against front-running and other Miner Extractable Value (MEV) attacks. It dynamically adjusts pool fees based on market conditionsâ€”namely, the volatility of pool price changes and the size of incoming swap orders. This adaptive fee mechanism discourages malicious actors from exploiting the pool while maintaining market liquidity.

## Overview

The MEV Protection Hook is implemented as a smart contract on Ethereum (written in Solidity 0.8.24) that integrates directly with Uniswap V4 pools via the pool manager interface. It monitors the market state at the time of a swap and calculates a dynamic fee based on:

- **Volatility EMA:** An exponential moving average of observed price fluctuations.
- **Swap Size EMA:** An exponential moving average of incoming swap sizes.
- **Cooldown Mechanism:** A time-based lock to prevent fees from being updated too frequently.

By adjusting fees dynamically, this hook aims to mitigate the risk of MEV and help maintain fair trading conditions.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Fee Adjustment:**  
  Calculates swap fees based on in-protocol metrics like volatility and swap size.
  
- **Cooldown Period:**  
  Implements a cooldown mechanism (with configurable parameters) to avoid rapid fee changes.
  
- **Optimized Stack Management:**  
  Uses internal helper functions and inner blocks to overcome Solidity's "stack too deep" issues.
  
- **Seamless Integration:**  
  Implements the Uniswap V4 hook interface, ensuring compatibility with existing liquidity pools.

## Architecture & Code Structure

### Contract: `MEVProtectionHook`

- **Inheritance:**  
  Inherits from `BaseHook`, ensuring that it meets the Uniswap V4 hook specifications.

- **FeeState Struct:**  
  Tracks key metrics for fee calculation:
  - `currentTick`: The current pool tick.
  - `lastUpdated`: The timestamp when fees were last updated.
  - `volatilityEMA`: Exponential moving average of price volatility.
  - `swapSizeEMA`: Exponential moving average of swap sizes.
  - `lastBlock`: The block number when the fee was last updated.

- **Primary Functions:**
  - **`getHookPermissions`:**  
    Configures the hook permissions. Only the `beforeSwap` hook is enabled.
    
  - **`beforeSwap`:**  
    - Enforces a cooldown period before recalculating the fee.
    - Retrieves pool state via the `IUniswapV4Pool` interface.
    - Computes the new fee based on the EMA of volatility and swap sizes.
    - Updates the fee state by delegating to the internal function `_updateFeeState`.
    - Calls the extended pool manager (`IPoolManagerExtended`) to set the newly computed fee.
    
  - **`_updateFeeState`:**  
    Updates fee state in storage field-by-field. This logic is moved into an internal function to release stack pressure.

- **Utility Function:**
  - **`_abs`:**  
    A helper to compute the absolute value of a given tick difference.

### Interfaces

- **`IUniswapV4Pool`:**  
  Minimal interface to read pool state (`slot0`), which returns the current sqrtPrice and tick.

- **`IPoolManagerExtended`:**  
  Extends the base `IPoolManager` interface with two key functions:
  - `pools`: Getter for the pool address (using a pool ID).
  - `setFee`: Updates the pool fee dynamically.

---

## Deployment & Usage

### Prerequisites

- **Foundry (Forge):** Ensure you have [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) installed.
- **Dependencies:**  
  Install compatible versions of Uniswap V4 core, periphery libraries, and Solmate.

### Compilation

Compile the contract using Forge:

```shell
$ forge build
```

### Deploying the Contract

Deploy the MEV Protection Hook by passing the address of the pool manager:

```solidity
IPoolManager poolManager = IPoolManager(poolManagerAddress);
MEVProtectionHook mevHook = new MEVProtectionHook(poolManager);
```

### Integration with Uniswap V4 Pools

To integrate, update the pool's hooks configuration:
- Set the pool hooks to the deployed `MEVProtectionHook` address.
- The pool manager will call `beforeSwap` during swap operations, which dynamically adjusts the fee based on the on-chain market state.

---

## Potential Enhancements

- **Parameter Adjustments:**  
  Allow governance to adjust constants (cooldown time, fee thresholds) to best adapt to changing market conditions.
  
- **Event Emissions:**  
  Emit events upon fee state updates for better off-chain monitoring and analytics.
  
- **Extended Testing:**  
  Develop a suite of tests simulating various market conditions to ensure optimal fee calculations.
